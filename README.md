# maze-solver
In this individual project, I utilized reinforcement learning techniques to determine the shortest possible pathway from a given starting point to an endpoint. The starting point is hard-coded as a preferred location.

Using reinforcement learning algorithms, the program explores and learns from different paths in order to identify the most efficient route to the endpoint. By leveraging reinforcement learning principles, the program can make informed decisions on which actions to take at each step to minimize the overall distance or time required to reach the endpoint.

The project's focus is on finding the optimal path, considering factors such as obstacles, terrain, or any other relevant constraints. By incorporating reinforcement learning, the program aims to provide an automated solution for determining the shortest pathway from the preferred starting point to the endpoint.
